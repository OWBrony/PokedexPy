# Overview

This is a program to pull info from the pokeAPI and display
it for the user. My intent is to learn how to pull from an external database
and display it for the user.

Currently, this program is in alpha. The part responsible for calling data is the API_Call.py in the API_Calling folder.
It is currently set up to display the default front sprite, pokemon name, the pokemon's abilities, and their base
stats.
