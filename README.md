# Overview

This is a program to pull info from the pokeAPI and display
it for the user. My intent is to learn how to pull from an external database
and display it for the user.

Currently, this program is in parts. The part responsible for calling data is the api_call_proto.py in the API_Calling folder.
It is currently set up to display the abilities of an entered pokemon name.

Currently, a database to write to is not implemented.

# Development Environment

The language that I am using is the python language.
